            If you haven't noticed, the mainstream media is working overtime to
            redefine financial freedom. When I was young, financial freedom
            meant Lamborghinis, fine dining, and a dream house in the hills.
            Today financial freedom means calling yourself a millionaire while
            fanatically brooding over suffocating budgets and how you can save
            another marginal buck out of your paycheck. Today financial freedom
            means driving a used car with 150,000 miles, not buying your spouse
            a birthday gift, and selling the same miserable existence to other
            people. Let me be clear. And it doesn't matter if you're a broke
            coed or one of these FIRE clowns who pounds his chest about
            "retiring early." If you're micromanaging every dollar in your life
            and thinking about money every passing hour, you're not financially
            free—you're financially enslaved. Financial freedom is walking into
            a store and not looking at prices. Financial freedom is deleting the
            Excel spreadsheets and nullifying the word "budget" from your life.
            Financial freedom is courtside NBA seats, impulsive shopping sprees,
            and living in a dream house that would rival any five-star resort.*
            Simply put, financial freedom is when you no longer think about
            money. If you want to suffer a tyrannical lifetime dictated by
            strict budgets and stock market returns, any one of the 1,420,204
            books on personal finance will do. However, if you want absolute
            financial freedom—the kind where money is inconsequential—The
            Millionaire Fastlane is the only book that shows you exactly how.

                <p>
                  A Sidewalker has no financial plan other than a FOMO mindset.
                  Every dollar earned is spent on image management (clothes,
                  cars, jewelry), leisure, and mindless entertainment
                  distractions. Excess wants are subsidized by debt. Sidewalkers
                  can earn millions and appear wealthy, for example,
                  professional athletes, but still are net-worth poor and live
                  paycheck-to-paycheck, gig-to-gig, or contract-to-contract. For
                  impoverished Sidewalkers, wealth is viewed through a lens of
                  welfare, lotteries, gambling, and even insurance scams.
                  Sidewalkers sacrifice their future for a comfortable now,
                  resulting in little to no net worth.

              Saving $100/month from your paycheck for untold decades won't make

            </h2>

            <p>
              Everything you've been taught about personal finance and wealth is
              bullshit, skillfully foisted upon you by a cartel of
              media-complicit bullshitters. The greatest deception ever cast
              upon you is this stale, recycled idea that militant frugality,
              suffocating saving, and dogmatic investing will someday make you
              rich. Here's the unsettling truth: Pick up any popular book about
              personal finance or wealth, and you'll read about an ugly pig
              called the Slowlane, but with different colors of lipstick. The
              Slowlane dogma sounds something like this:
            </p>

            <p>
              Stop drinking Starbucks, stop dining out, stop wearing trendy
              clothes, stop driving newer cars, stop flushing the toilet and
              wasting water, stop this, stop that because one day—after you've
              religiously invested every cent saved from your boring life into
              an index fund—you're going to be rich!
            </p>

            <p>
              No, saving money is not foolish. What's foolish is this ideology
              that investing a tiny percentage of your paycheck will yield
              wealth sometime in the distant future. Using this strategy for
              wealth is like throwing the local college's soccer club up against
              Manchester United and expecting them to win. Saving pitiful
              amounts of money simply can't compete against a volatile job
              market, mortal life-expectancy, and rampant government-induced
              inflation.
            </p>

            <p>You're bringing a butter knife to a gunfight.</p>

            <p>
              The Slowlane is survival finance. The paradigm shift is realizing
              the paradigm is shit. The solution to this insanity of living life
              to the lessor is not to sharpen your butter knife, but to throw it
              away. The Millionaire Fastlane isn't about surviving, it's about
              thriving.

            moment I finished it, sitting in my car, making $9/hour as a
            security guard, all the way to starting my own business and buying a
            Porsche within 3 years.

              The millionaire next door lives like a broke coed. The new
              psychology of money is to be so fanatically possessed by money
              you'll need a priest and an exorcist. Money, master the game by
              not playing the same game that made me rich. And my favorite, I
              will teach you to be rich by making you more poor by selling you a
              training course that costs more than 3 brand new iPhones. Follow
              the advice therein and you won't earn financial freedom; you'll
              earn my condolences. You just swallowed the blue pill, a lifetime
              prison of mediocrity and abstinence. Yes, you'll own nothing, buy
              nothing, do nothing, and be happy. Don't let any best-selling
              author convince you (or the media outlets pushing them) that
              financial enslavement in your vibrant youth is a good bet for
              financial freedom in your elderly twilight. Think! These
              best-selling authors live fabulously without financial burdens,
              but not because they stayed away from Starbucks two million times,
              but because two million people bought the BS in their book.
              Thousands bought their upsells. In other words, they sold the
              Slowlane, but got rich in the Fastlane. You see, there's an ugly
              truth behind every personal finance book: What they sell doesn't
              create life-changing wealth; it creates life-inhibiting bondage.
              But, if they sell the Slowlane scheme to enough fools who believe
              it, they can escape the very paradigm they promote.

            <p>
              Hello, my name is MJ DeMarco, and I've been an entrepreneur my
              entire life. My career has allowed me to make tens of millions of
              dollars over my life, including the ability to pursue my passion
              for writing. In short, I've been living a dream for over 20 years.
              Today, I am the founder of Viperion Publishing (the publisher of
              The Millionaire Fastlane) and The Fastlane Forum, a worldwide
              community for Fastlane entrepreneurs seeking to escape the cult of
              mediocrity. I'm also the co-founder of GoalSumo.com, an intuitive
              task and productivity system designed to engineer a roadmap to
              your best life. If you were anything like me when I was twenty,
              you've become disillusioned and distrustful of slick-talking gurus
              who sell big promises at big prices. After my second business exit
              and realizing I never had to work another day in my life, I
              started writing The Millionaire Fastlane. I wrote the book as if I
              were in a time machine and could write to my younger self, a
              period rife with failures, mistakes, and dumb ideas. With zero
              sugarcoating, what had I wished I known? If I could go back and
              speak to 21-year-old me, what lessons would I impart? A few years
              later, The Millionaire Fastlane was born. And the book came with a
              promise: I would never use high-pressure sales funnels and push
              people into an upsell at any price. Yes, no expensive seminars. No
              high-priced coaching programs or training courses. No personal
              mentorships if only pay me $10,000. As an author, I promised my
              readers that there would never be "more to buy" to get to the
              "secret sauce." Any of my books will lead you to financial freedom
              without the oppresive frugality and cult-like saving schemes. Read
              one, or read them all. You will never be sold anything else. I'll
              leave you with this even if you decide to pass on reading my book.
              Learning how to make a fortune should never cost a fortune. If it
              does, put away the credit card and run the other way. I've heard
              far too many horror stories about a $5000 "coaching program" that
              didn't deliver same punch as my book. Read it and change your
              life. And spare yourself from ever having to fall for another guru
              pitch again. My best wishes for your success and happiness,
            </p>
